# Strange Bill Journey
A platformer inspired by Super Mario Bros and The Great Giana Sisters. It's made in Godot.

## Story
One day, in a village full of squares that look the same, a fire started! 

However, this fire was done using magic, and no one in the village knew how to do magic, and when a square named Bill saw it, he realized that this was done by a creature named Doz! 

So Bill decides to go for a strange journey to stop Doz!

## Controls

## How To Play or Edit (Using the source code)
You'll need to download Godot 4.4.1, as this was made using that version of Godot.
